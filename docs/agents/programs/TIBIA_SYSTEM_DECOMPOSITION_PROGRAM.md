# Mission

Maintain one durable logical decomposition of Tibia and Canary through the existing Real Tibia registry so agents can discover bounded domains, coordinate work, map upstream changes, assign proof layers and later classify migration work for Oteryn without changing gameplay or physically reorganizing the legacy source tree.

This program is architecture, registry metadata, documentation and coordination only. It never authorizes runtime changes.

# Source-of-truth and safety contract

The only canonical module inventory is `docs/agents/real-tibia/registry/**`. Generated indexes are derived artifacts; package reports explain decisions but are not a second registry.

Permanent rules:

- path hints are discovery, not ownership or edit authorization;
- broad existing IDs remain stable umbrellas;
- narrow records use verified current paths and never broad server `src/**`;
- `depends_on` means a fundamental dependency and must remain acyclic;
- file/schema/helper/migration/test presence supports at most inventory;
- no TSD package claims gameplay/runtime, persistence, protocol, parity, E2E or Oteryn readiness;
- no second registry, generator, watcher, mapper, parser, renderer or E2E orchestrator;
- no physical source-tree refactor or normal-task edit to `ACTIVE_WORK.md`.

New decomposition records start at lifecycle/implementation/evidence `inventory`; persistence, protocol, automated tests, runtime validation and gameplay E2E stay `not-assessed` unless a later narrow proof task establishes otherwise.

# Current active package — TSD-008

Task: `CAN-20260714-tibia-system-decomposition-world-content`; draft PR #368.

Registry 49 → 52. Added only:

```text
instances
world-map-runtime
world-zones
```

Existing records modified: 0. Quests, NPCs, houses, OTBM tooling, raids, spawns, item/container, persistence and physical-client E2E records remain stable.

Classification:

- Map/MapCache/Tile/IOMap, spatial lookup, movement, visibility and pathfinding → `world-map-runtime`;
- static/dynamic zone registry, area indexing, membership caches and remove destination → `world-zones`;
- configured region pool, instance state, creature ownership isolation, cleanup and expiration → `instances`;
- map loading, tiles, movement, pathfinding, towns and waypoints remain capabilities inside runtime map;
- teleports and floor transitions remain deferred findings because they have no independent current implementation root;
- NPC/boat/carpet travel stays inside NPC/quest boundaries;
- houses, spawns, raids, OTBM analysis and world persistence remain already covered.

Implementation/focused-test head `360e478cbebc756f60933e547801307e7db805e7` passed:

- Real Tibia Module Registry #330;
- Upstream Intelligence #362;
- Agent Task Ownership #1186;
- repository CI #2304;
- focused registry/source-role tests;
- schema/dependency validation;
- deterministic `generate --check`;
- discovery and exact PR-range `affected`.

Repair history: the first manual path-index materialization accidentally removed the existing `src/io/iobestiary.* → cyclopedia` row. Focused tests and schema validation passed, while `generate --check` failed. The existing row was restored without changing TSD-008 scope, paths or runtime behavior; the next exact-head generator gate passed.

Detailed evidence: `docs/agents/real-tibia/TSD_008_WORLD_CONTENT_REPORT.md`.

No completed package evidence establishes OTBM runtime load completeness, map/movement/pathfinding, zone membership, travel or teleport semantics, instance isolation/cleanup/expiration, persistence, protocol compatibility, physical-client E2E, Real Tibia parity or Oteryn readiness.

# Oteryn migration policy

The legacy repository remains the evidence laboratory. No code is copied to Oteryn by this program. Classification defaults to undecided or `REVALIDATE` until inventory, evidence, runtime proof and E2E proof exist.

# Exact next operational task

After PR #368 passes final exact-head review, ready-state Linux/Required, squash merge and a separate lifecycle archive, re-read then-current `main` and create only:

```text
task: CAN-20260714-tibia-system-decomposition-social-communication-trust
package: TSD-009
branch: docs/tibia-system-decomposition-social-communication-trust
```

Preserve account lifecycle/authentication, NPC, protocol, player/world persistence and existing gameplay records. Add only durable communication, party/guild, trust/sanction or audit boundaries supported by independent current implementation roots.

# Handoff

Continue one task, branch and PR at a time. Re-read current main, open PRs, active tasks and ownership before every package. Preserve all proof limits and never infer behavioral correctness from inventory paths or passing CI.
